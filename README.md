# BVNK - Distributed banking 

BVNK is distributed banking infrastructure that aims to turn banking from a product into a utility.
The network is completely decentralized including data where data will be secured using strong and industry standard cryptography. 
Using public key cryptography, network consensus and threshold cryptography this system can be safely implemented.
